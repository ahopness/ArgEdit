Godot 3.x plugin that adds a LineEdit + a ToggleButton nodes within the editor's toolbar to make it easier to add cmd arguments to test your game/app on.

It's really useful if your game/app uses custom arguments or u just want to change the engine's startup settings without actually changing them in the ProjectSettings.

*(also: yes, it saves and loads properly on editor startup)*
